# automatedDryFoodDispenser
Code by Tricia Pardave
Design by Laura Gould and Sergio Segovia

My team and I had five days to created a fully functioning automated dry food dispenser. 
We had access to 3D printers and several Arduino boards and motors.

My role in the project to assemble the microcontroller, servo motor, and RTC clock module and write the code to have them all work in tandem.
